*PSYCHOTHERAPY-PROJECT*

Psychotherapy’s Current State

•	There is no systematic means of tracking VA psychotherapy services or Veteran clinical responses
•	Understanding, documenting, and continually improving the quality of VA  psychotherapy services depends on routine collection of           minimally necessary information to link:
		•		The Veteran’s mental health conditions and problems that are the focus of psychotherapy sessions,
		•		The psychotherapy services provided, and
		•		Veteran reported outcomes
		•		Collecting this essential information provides the basis for a robust quality management system for quality assurance and quality         improvement 

Psychotherapy Measurement Feedback System  

Psychotherapy Tracker 

•	Identifies the condition or problem that’s the focus of the psychotherapy session
•	Captures Veteran reported outcome measures
•	Description of the psychotherapy services delivered

Psychotherapy Tools

•	Decision support tools to inform clinical judgement and improve Veteran outcomes
•	Identification of Veterans who are at increased risk for drop out, limited clinical benefit, or deterioration
•	Generation of practice-based evidence

Outcome Informed Treatment

•	Outcome feedback improves treatment outcomes
•	A meta-analysis of 6 major trials estimated that patients who were classified as ‘not on track’ during treatment were 2.3 times more       likely to deteriorate in usual therapy, by comparison to therapy + Outcome Feedback
•	In published controlled trials, effect sizes favoring Outcome Feedback range between d = 0.2 and d = 0.9
•	Importantly, Outcome Feedback helps to prevent deterioration
